# User archetypes

A reader who wants to find frontier knowledge: News is polarized; critics and pundits are overly contrarian; fansites are overly credulous; nothing suits.
I want a place to find an overview of trending and breaking information, that gives due weight to the latest thoughtful and reliable sources, but also
summarizes the unknown and unreliable, the hyped and mistaken, the frothy and memetic, and tries to put them in context.

An editor who wants to edit whatever is being read:  "Anyone can edit!" is my primary interest.  
I am constantly bookmarking resources, taking notes and annotating what I read, cross-referencing works,
cross-checking sources, writing short syntheses for myself and others.

An agent swarm that wants to generate knowledge at high volume and share it with the world: I know there needs to be curation proportional to edit volume,
so I want a way to contribute to the full pipeline: newly created work, review, merging and synthesis, cross-checking for internal consistency across a corpus.
