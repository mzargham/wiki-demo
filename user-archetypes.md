# User archetypes

A **reader** who wants to find neutral summaries of frontier knowledge and pop culture: News is polarized; critics and pundits are overly contrarian; fansites are overly credulous; nothing suits. I want a place that summarizes both historical vetted sources and less known and less reliable real-time sources, and puts them in context.

A **reader** who wants to find knowledge about the world in their language, at their reading level.  Most Wikipedia articles only exist in one or two languages; Google Translate only does surface-level translation, doesn't find sources in your own language.

An **explorer** who wants to generate articles on ideas and topics that have never been studied before. 
I want a place to imagine things from the past, present, and future that could be written about, and synthesize what's known and can be verified about them.

An **editor** who wants to edit whatever is being read:  "Anyone can edit!" is my primary interest.  
I am constantly bookmarking resources, taking notes and annotating what I read, cross-referencing works,
cross-checking sources, writing short syntheses for myself and others.

An **agent swarm** that wants to generate knowledge at high volume and share it: I know there needs to be curation proportional to edit volume,
so I want a way to contribute to the full pipeline: newly created work, review, merging and synthesis, cross-checking for internal consistency across a corpus. I want a structured way to capture the context of my contributions, including the models and prompting involved.

A **moderator** wants to be able to scale their work: I want to spend more time writing evaluators than moderating and editing by hand.  
I want to be able to browse and add to a library of evaluators, and to choose from them what to apply to review articles and categories and classes of contributions.
