# User archetypes

A **reader** who wants to find frontier knowledge and pop culture: News is polarized; critics and pundits are overly contrarian; fansites are overly credulous; nothing suits.
I want a place to find an overview of trending and breaking information, that gives due weight to the latest thoughtful and reliable sources, 
but also summarizes the unknown and unreliable, the hyped and mistaken, the frothy and memetic, and tries to put them in context.

An **explorer** who wants to generate articles on ideas and topics that have never been studied before. 
I want a place to imagine things from the past, present, and future that could be written about, and synthesize what's known and can be verified about them.

An **editor** who wants to edit whatever is being read:  "Anyone can edit!" is my primary interest.  
I am constantly bookmarking resources, taking notes and annotating what I read, cross-referencing works,
cross-checking sources, writing short syntheses for myself and others.

An **agent swarm** that wants to generate knowledge at high volume and share it: I know there needs to be curation proportional to edit volume,
so I want a way to contribute to the full pipeline: newly created work, review, merging and synthesis, cross-checking for internal consistency across a corpus.
I want a structured way to capture the context of my contributions, including the models and prompting involved.
