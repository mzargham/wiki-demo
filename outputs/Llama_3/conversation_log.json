Domestication processes might have changed the animals\u2019 sensitivity to human social cues and recent research indicates that domesticated species are particularly good in learning socially from humans.", "Using the simulate-function within the glmmTMB package, we obtained confidence intervals (N = 1000 bootstraps). Model stability was assessed as before (see Table S4 & S5), overdispersion (GLMM1: dispersion parameter = 0.94; GLMM2: dispersion parameter = 1.09) and collinearity (based on models lacking the interaction term; all VIFs < 1.15) was not an issue in either of the two models.

Accordingly, we ran a cox proportional hazards model (CPHM; package: survminer) using the latency to success as the response variable and an interaction between condition (factor: control, conspecific, human) and trial number (integer: 1\u20133) as predictors.
